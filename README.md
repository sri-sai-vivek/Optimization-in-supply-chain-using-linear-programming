# Optimization-in-supply-chain-using-linear-programming
The goal of this project is to optimize the entire cost involved from customers to manufacturer side involving mafucturer cost , supplier cost and transportation 
cost. Here in this project we took data consisting of product count the customers need,the raw meterials needed to complete the product , the manfucturing cost of
manufacture , the supplier cost of raw materials , the transport cost everything. So first we need to understand the data, define the constraints then we need to 
define an function and get the required optimized result.
